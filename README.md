### Authentication Process

### Backend Setup

- **Install Dependencies**:
  - `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
  - `mongoose`: ODM for MongoDB.
  - `bcryptjs`: Library for hashing passwords.
  - `jsonwebtoken`: Library for generating and verifying JWTs.
  - `body-parser`: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.

- **User Model**:
  - Define a `User` schema with `username` and `password` fields.
  - Hash passwords before saving using `bcryptjs`.
  - Include a method to compare hashed passwords during login.

- **Routes**:
  - **Sign Up** (`/api/auth/signup`):
    - Create a new user with a hashed password and save it to MongoDB.
  - **Login** (`/api/auth/login`):
    - Verify the user's credentials and generate a JWT if valid.
  - **Logout** (`/api/auth/logout`):
    - Invalidate the JWT on the client-side (usually by removing it from localStorage or cookies).

### Frontend Integration

- **Sign Up Form**:
  - Collect `username` and `password` from the user.
  - Send a POST request to `/api/auth/signup` to create a new user.

- **Login Form**:
  - Collect `username` and `password` from the user.
  - Send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` to authenticate the user.
  - Store the received JWT in localStorage or cookies for subsequent requests.

- **Logout**:
  - Remove the JWT from client-side storage (localStorage or cookies).
  - Redirect the user to the login page.
